## ‚≠ê Special Thanks

A massive shoutout to the brilliant developers whose work made this resource possible! Your contributions to the FiveM community are absolutely legendary:

- **[gottfriedleibniz](https://github.com/citizenfx/lua/blob/luaglm-dev/cfx/libs/scripts/examples/dataview.lua)** for the DataView implementation that powers our object manipulation
- **[Andyyy7666](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/pull/453)** for the gizmo functionality enhancements in ox_lib
- **[AvarianKnight](https://forum.cfx.re/t/allow-drawgizmo-to-be-used-outside-of-fxdk/5091845/8?u=demi-automatic)** for making DrawGizmo accessible outside of FXDK
- **[DemiAutomatic](https://github.com/DemiAutomatic/object_gizmo)** for the original object gizmo implementation

These legends have paved the way for better object manipulation tools in FiveM. Without their hard work and willingness to share their knowledge, this resource wouldn't exist.
